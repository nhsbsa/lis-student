<h2 class="heading-medium">What you need to know before you start</h2>

    <p>During the online application, we'll ask for information about:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>income - how much you (or your partner) get from any jobs, pensions, or benefits</li>
        <li>housing costs - what you (or your partner) pay for things like Council Tax, rent, and utilities </li>
        <li>educational courses (if you are a student) - what and where you are studying, what your term dates are, and how your course is funded</li>
      </ul>


<h2 class="heading-medium">What we will ask you to send us</h2>

      <p>If you or your partner get them, we will ask you to send us copies of your:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>payslips</li>
          <li>latest Working Tax Credit award notice</li>
          <li>latest Universal Credit monthly statement</li>
        </ul>


<h2 class="heading-medium">What happens after your application</h2>

        <p>Once you complete your application, you will receive a reference number for any queries you may have.
          <br><br>
          Your application will then be processed and you will be contacted when a decision has been made.
          <br><br>
          If you are entitled to help, you will get either an:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>

              </a> 
              for full help with health costs - this includes free NHS prescriptions

              </a>
