            <p>If you pay NHS prescription charges, then find out later that you're entitled to free prescriptions,
                you
                may be
                able to claim a refund.
                <br><br>
                You'll need to ask your pharmacist for an FP57 refund receipt when you pay as you cannot get one
                later.
