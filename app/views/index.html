                                <li>Students struggled in a set scenario involving money from a relative at the /money-coming-in page.

                            <li>Term dates : Users struggled to identify their holiday dates and some students do not start in Sept - there are Jan / April intake etc - therefore asking for holiday dates will be a blocker for these cluster of users.
                                In addition to that students who are in medical / health field do not have the standard 3 terms (due to having placements etc) and will not be able to continue with the journey.
                            So a decision was made to re-design the user journey for term dates in R6 </li>
                            <li>Done Page : User expected to receive Help with Health costs (and thought they can start getting prescription) straight after their application has been submitted 
                                by seeing the DONE word in the DONE page. So it was decided to look into the content and potential re-design for this screen in R6</li>
